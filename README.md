# Spotify Ad Blocker
 A simple productivity script to "Block" ads on spotify for Desktop
 
 
 As a student I don't really have the money to purchase spotify premium so I made this script. When the spotify desktop client (Win10) is relaunched, the status of the ad is reset and it goes back to music. There are some cosmetic issues (Like the spotify icon glowing orange in the task bar when reopened) that will I will likely soon fix. 
 
 
 To setup go to https://developer.spotify.com/ and create a developer account. Create a new app and set the callback URI to http://localhost:8080/callback. Put your client id and client secret in the script as well with your spotify username.
